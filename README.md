# Sorting Algorithm Visualization
This code is a visualization tool for sorting algorithms using the Pygame library. It allows you to see how different sorting algorithms rearrange a list of numbers in ascending or descending order.

## Features
- Visualize the sorting process of different algorithms (`Insertion Sort` and `Bubble Sort`)
- Control sorting speed
- Control the number of elements in the list
- Control the range of the elements in the list

## How to Use
- Run the code and you will see an empty window with a list of controls at the top
- Press `R` to **reset** the list, `<SPACE>` to **start** sorting, `A` for **ascending order** and `D` for **descending order**
- Press `I` for **Insertion Sort** and `B` for **Bubble Sort**
- Enjoy the visualization of the sorting process

## Note
This code is provided as is and is not production ready. 

## Dependency
`Pygame`

## Installation
